If we can use a simple sentence to explain what is blockchain, we can say blockchain is about how to enforce a set of rules without a control center.Think about a bank to enforce a set of money transaction rule, you deposit your
money into a bank, and the bank should keep you money safe with the right amount. If you save 100 dollars in the bank, the bank need to give you a proof that you have 100 dollars in their hand and they need to give back the 
same a mount of dollar when you want to check the out. The bank can't manipulate you money that is they can't change you amount of saving from 100 to 50, and they need to give the money to you when you withdraw.

But the set of rules need to be followed by the bank, you have risk that the bank may change your saving amount, or refuse to give the money back to you when you decide to withdraw. That is the set of rules are enforced by an 
entity you don't have any power to involved with them. You need to count on the integrity of the central controller to follow the rule, if they are corrupted and bend the rules, you can do nothing, a centralized patter is like
following, when the center is rotted, the whole system would crush:

The real inovation of blockchain is that, it can remove the center while make sure the given set of rules can still be applied. That is you can save your money on the blockchain and there is not any entity in the world can 
control the system and the amount you save can changed by no one and you are 100% sure you can get back your money with the right amount when you withdraw, the pattern for blockchain which make the system decentralized is as
following:

How the magic happended when the set of rules can automatically followed by any one and not a centralized entity using its power to enforce the rule? The secret lies in the data structure and algorithm operate on the structure.
The structure is many blocks connect with each other just like a chain:


![rust blockchain](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a6996af-8b38-4488-a948-c0d17dc708d9)

Each block has four core components: previous hash, timestamp, nonce, and transactions. All info related to the system will save in the transactions, such as the amount of money you save is stored in the component of 
transactions in a given block. If someone want to change your amount, he need to change the transaction component, but this will easily get caught because this will break the previous hash component in nearly all the blocks,
therefore when someone want to change a bit in the transactions of given one block, he need to change all blocks!

Even the guy has the power to change all blocks, since there are thousands nodes scatter around the worlds that are saving the same copy of the chains, therefore if one want to change something in the transactions of given
block, he need to compromise all thousands of nodes around the world and change all blocks in those nodes which is physically impossible.

Until now, we seems know something about the blockchain, but the reality is we don't even scratch the tip of the iceberg, in order to totally make clear the beauty blockchain, we need to see through it by the code instead of
plain language, that's what we going to do in next section.
