In this section, we will see how to add transaction to block and we will explore how to use trait from Rust to add more powerful capability to our blockchain. First let's define the transaction, a transaction is a 
record of value transfer, it just like how you send money to others from a bank, it will record the sender, recipient, and the amount of value, following is how we define it, first we create a new file named 
transaction.rs and add the following code:

```rs
//referencing parent or sibling modules by absolute path
use crate::blockchain::*;

use std::fmt;
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Transaction {
    sender_address: Vec<u8>,
    recipient_address: Vec<u8>,
    value: u64,
}

impl Transaction {
    pub fn new(sender: Vec<u8>, recipient: Vec<u8>, value: u64) -> Transaction {
        Transaction {
            sender_address: sender,
            recipient_address: recipient,
            value,
        }
    }
}

```

The transaction object will contain three fields, one is for the sender address on the blockchain, second is the recipient address, and the third is how much the sender will give to the recipient. Now here comes to the
problem, according to our block struct design, we need the transaction as a kind of byte array, but currently our transaction is a struct which means we need some way to convert it to byte array. One way of converting
an object into an byte array is to serialize it, and convert a byte array into an object is called deserialize.

Serialization and deserializaton are ofenly used when we want to save object into a kind of medium like disk, database or send it over network. Therefore such capability not only wanted by the transaction object, but
also for block and even the blockchain object, but how can we enable all these three objects to have the capability of  serialization and deserialization? One way we can do is using trait. Trait in Rust is a very 
powerful mechanisim, if you are familiar OOP like languages such as c++, java, you can see trait as interface, but actually they are not the same thing, but now let's treat trait as interface.

Then we can define a trait with given methods like following in mod.js

```js
pub trait Serialization<T> {
    pub fn serialization(&self) -> Vec<u8>;
    pub fn deserialization(bytes: Vec<u8>) -> T;
}
```
We can see from the aboved code, we define trait with two methods with only their signature without implementation, the concret type will responsible for implmenting them. And we notices that is contains a type 
parameter which is T, this can add much flexible to the trait, that is if the Transaction struct implement this trait, then T would be type of Transaction then the method deserialization will return a Transaction
object, if struct Block to implement the trait, then T would be Block and deserialization will return object of Block.

The second thing we need to know is that method serialization in the trait can have self as parameter, it means this is an instance method, it need to pass the reference of the instance that implement this trait to
the method, it just like method of struct. The deserialization do not need the self parameter which means it is a static method! that's a difference from interface with c++ or java which not allow interface to have
static method.

Let's see how to implement the given trait to transaction, in transaction.rs we have code as following:
```rs
impl Serialization<Transaction> for Transaction {
    fn serialization(&self) -> Vec<u8> {
        /*
        1,8 bytes for length of sender address vector
        2,bytes for sender address vector
        3,8 bytes for length of recipient address vector
        4, bytes for recipient address vector
        5,8 bytes for length of value
        6, bytes of value
        */
        let mut bin = Vec::<u8>::new();
        let len_sender = self.sender_address.len();
        bin.extend(len_sender.to_be_bytes().to_vec());
        bin.extend(&self.sender_address);
        let len_recipient = self.recipient_address.len();
        bin.extend(len_recipient.to_be_bytes().to_vec());
        bin.extend(&self.recipient_address);
        let len_value = self.value.to_be_bytes().len();
        bin.extend(len_value.to_be_bytes().to_vec());
        bin.extend(self.value.to_be_bytes().to_vec());
        bin
    }

    fn deserialization(bytes: Vec<u8>) -> Transaction {
        //1, first 8 bytes are length of sender address
        let mut pos = 0;
        /*
        from_be_bytes expect to receive byte array [u8; len]
        but bytes[pos..pos+8] is slice, the try_into trait convert slice to
        array
        */
        let len_sender = usize::from_be_bytes(bytes[pos..pos + 8].try_into().unwrap());
        let mut sender_address = Vec::<u8>::new();
        pos += 8;
        //2. bytes to sender address
        sender_address.extend_from_slice(&bytes[pos..pos + len_sender]);
        pos += len_sender;
        //3, 8 bytes are length of recipient address
        let len_recipient = usize::from_be_bytes(bytes[pos..pos + 8].try_into().unwrap());
        pos += 8;
        //4. bytes to recipient address
        let mut recipient_address = Vec::<u8>::new();
        recipient_address.extend_from_slice(&bytes[pos..pos + len_recipient]);
        pos += len_recipient;
        //5, 8 bytes for length of value
        let len_value = usize::from_be_bytes(bytes[pos..pos + 8].try_into().unwrap());
        pos += 8;
        //6,read the content of value
        let value: u64 = u64::from_be_bytes(bytes[pos..pos + 8].try_into().unwrap());
        pos += 8;
        Transaction {
            sender_address,
            recipient_address,
            value,
        }
    }
}

```

Then we can test the aboved code in main.rs as following:

```js
use crate::blockchain::Serialization;
fn main() {
    let tx = Transaction::new(
        "sender".as_bytes().to_vec(),
        "recipient".as_bytes().to_vec(),
        100,
    );
    println!("tx before serilization: {:?}", tx);
    let tx_bin = tx.serialization();
    println!("bin of tx: {:?}", tx_bin);
    let tx_1 = Transaction::deserialization(tx_bin);
    println!("tx from bin: {:?}", tx_1);
}
```
Then run the aboved code we get the following:
```rs
tx before serilization: Transaction { sender_address: [115, 101, 110, 100, 101, 114], recipient_address: [114, 101, 99, 105, 112, 105, 101, 110, 116], value: 100 }
bin of tx: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 115, 101, 110, 100, 101, 114, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 114, 101, 99, 105, 112, 105, 101, 110, 116, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 100]
tx from bin: Transaction { sender_address: [115, 101, 110, 100, 101, 114], recipient_address: [114, 101, 99, 105, 112, 105, 101, 110, 116], value: 100 }
```

As we can see from aboved output, the content of transaction object can match up when we serializaze it to bytes array and then convert it back. We can implement trait we defined but also can implement trait defined
by the third party. For example, we used to call a print method to print out our own defined object, how about we want the derivative println to print our own defined object? Then we need to implement a trait from
fmt module as following:

```rs
use std::fmt;
...
impl fmt::Display for Transaction {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(
            f,
            "{}\nsender address: {:?}\nreceipent address: {:?}\n,value:{}\n {}",
            "-".repeat(40),
            self.sender_address,
            self.recipient_address,
            self.value,
            "-".repeat(40)
        )
    }
}
```
In aboved code, the fmt::Display trait is used to show content for println!, we need to implement its fmt method in the trait like aboved, in aboved code we are using the write! macro to construct a fmt::Result
object, then the println! will know how to display the content of object which it never seen before.

Then we can try the aboved code in main.rs like following:

```rs
println!("transaction for display trait: {}", tx);
```
Then the output would like following:
```rs
transaction for display trait:
 ----------------------------------------
sender address: [115, 101, 110, 100, 101, 114]
receipent address: [114, 101, 99, 105, 112, 105, 101, 110, 116]
value:100
 ----------------------------------------
```


When a transaction is ready, we need to add it to the pool of blockchain first, then when a block is minted(we will see what is mint later), then we can add all those transactions to a block, let's try to using trait
to implement the adding of transaction  :

```rs
impl BlockChain {
....

  pub fn create_block(&mut self, nonce: i32, previous_hash: Vec<u8>) {
        let mut b = Block::new(nonce, previous_hash);
        for tx in self.transaction_pool.iter() {
            b.transactions.push(tx.clone());
        }
        self.transaction_pool.clear();
        //the chain own the block
        self.chain.push(b);
    }

 pub fn add_transaction(&mut self, tx: &impl Serialization<Transaction>) {
        for tx_in_pool in self.transaction_pool.iter() {
            if *tx_in_pool == tx.serialization() {
                break;
            }
        }

        self.transaction_pool.push(tx.serialization())
    }

}
```

We can see from aboved code, if a function expect to receive a trait as input, it will use &impl trait_name as the type of parameter.
